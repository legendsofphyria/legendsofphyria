Legends of Phyria
==================
Legends of Phyria is a project that I'm working on in American Government for something called 20% Time, where students
are encouraged to work on projects that pique their interests, but enough intro, lets talk about the game.

Legends is going to be a 2D tile-based JRPG written in Java using LWJGL. As a novice programmer I feel that even if I
do not succeed in finishing this game by January, I wil continue development in order to both create an appealing game
and to further my skills as a programmer.
